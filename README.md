This is a interactive,single-user point of sale system. The system is extremely easy to use and can be used for a small shop to manage customers, products and inventory.

    Customer and Product operations have functions to add, update details, delete, find, and list all products and customers.Attributes such as customer ID and Product ID are unique to each customer and product respectively.
